# LPR-Analysis
Conducted an in-depth analysis of Legal Permanent Resident (LPR) trends using publicly available immigration datasets. Sourced data from multiple government and research portals, cleaned and transformed it for consistency, and built an interactive Power BI dashboard to uncover key migration patterns.

Researched and gathered LPR-related data from diverse public sources, including DHS, USCIS, and academic datasets, ensuring a comprehensive view of green card distribution trends.

Cleaned, standardized, and transformed raw datasets using Power Query and DAX in Power BI, preparing the data for insightful visualization and analysis.

Designed and developed a Power BI dashboard that segmented LPR trends into three key themes: Visa Category (Employment, Family, Refugee/Asylee), Geographic Distribution, and Year-over-Year Trends.

Enabled stakeholders to explore regional immigration dynamics, identify policy impacts, and assess demographic shifts through interactive filters, charts, and summary KPIs.
